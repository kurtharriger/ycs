# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the YourCommunity.Space platform (“Project”).

To ensure the long-term success of this public-good initiative, we ask all contributors to agree to the terms below. These terms allow the project steward (currently Kurt Harriger) to manage, license, and sustain the project in alignment with its mission.

By submitting contributions, you agree that:

1. **License Grant**: You grant the project steward a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publicly display, sublicense, and relicense your contributions as part of the Project.

2. **Future Relicensing**: The project steward may relicense the Project, including your contributions, to ensure alignment with the mission and support long-term sustainability.

3. **Attribution**: You retain copyright in your contributions. You agree that your contributions may be included in the Project without additional attribution, unless explicitly requested.

4. **Nonprofit Stewardship**: You understand that while the steward is currently an individual, the intention is for the code to be transferred to a nonprofit entity to ensure transparency, community benefit, and long-term protection.

5. **No Obligation**: This agreement does not obligate the project steward to include or use your contribution.

By submitting a pull request, issue, or patch, you confirm that you have the right to license your contributions under these terms.
