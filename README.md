# Our Mission

## The internet promised connection. We got onetization.

Most platforms today are built for profit.  
They optimize for ads, not relationships.  
They put fees between people and events.  
They reward engagement over well-being.  

Organizers burn out. Volunteers go unseen.  
Community becomes content. People become data.

## YCS is different. We serve people, not shareholders.

We believe community should be open and accessible.  
We believe organizers and volunteers deserve support, not obstacles.  
We believe technology should deepen connection, not distract from it.

## Reclaiming the digital commons

If you’ve felt something human is missing online...  
If you’ve wanted a place to gather, not perform...  

**This is Your Community Space.**  
Join us. Build with us. Make space for what matters.
